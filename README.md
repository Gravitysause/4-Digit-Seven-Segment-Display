# 4-Digit-Seven-Segment-Display
Using an Arduino Uno, this will control a F3461BH (Common Anode Version). The program will do this by displaying the number of one digit, and then switching to the next digit and so on. 

I plan on using a 74hc595 to switch between the LEDs, but I still need to do some research on how those work.
